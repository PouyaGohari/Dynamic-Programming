## Introduction

This repository contains solutions to three different problems using dynamic programming. Dynamic programming is a powerful algorithmic technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed the latest version of C++.
- You have a basic understanding of dynamic programming algorithms.

## Installation

To clone and run this repository locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PouyaGohari/Dynamic-Programming.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Dynamic-Programming
## Usage

To compile and run the algorithms, use the following commands:
1. Compile the code:
      ```sh
   g++ -o output_file source_file.cpp
3. Run the executable:
   ```sh
   ./output_file
